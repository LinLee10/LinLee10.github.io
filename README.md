# Collin Lee’s Portfolio

I build high-impact data solutions across computer vision, time-series forecasting, NLP, and more. Below are a few highlights:

- **Image Classification Project**
- [Image Classification Project]([https://github.com/LinLee10/image-classification-project](https://github.com/LinLee10/Regression_Exploration/tree/main)) 
  Transfer-learned MobileNetV2 in Colab to classify ten custom image categories—reaching **91%** validation accuracy in under 20 epochs, with real-time training visualization and experiment tracking via Weights & Biases.

- **Time-Series Forecasting**  
  Engineered windowed LSTM models to predict next-day rainfall across multiple stations—achieving a **0.48″ RMSE** and **R² = 0.86** on held-out data, outperforming persistence baselines by over 20%.

- **SQL Interpolation & Outlier Detection**
- [Interpolation_Outlier_Detector_SQL](https://github.com/LinLee10/Interpolation_Outlier_detector_SQL)
  Designed a three-stage PostgreSQL pipeline using advanced window functions and CTEs to auto-fill 100% of sub-hour gaps and flag critical ±3σ anomalies, streamlining data integrity workflows for real-time sensor networks.

- **Stock News Sentiment Analysis**  
  Built an end-to-end FinBERT pipeline that scrapes financial headlines, quantifies sentiment, and backtests trading signals—generating **12.5% annualized returns** vs. **6.3%** buy-and-hold, with automated report generation.

- **Regression Exploration**
- [Regression Exploration](https://github.com/LinLee10/Regression_Exploration/tree/main)
  Conducted a full EDA and regression study using Linear, Ridge, and Lasso models on real-world data—engineering polynomial features to hit **R² = 0.78** and **RMSE = 2.4**, complete with interactive visualizations.
